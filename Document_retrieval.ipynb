johns hopkins center for health security abbreviated chs is an independent nonprofit organization of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. the center works to protect people’s health from epidemics and pandemics and ensures that communities are resilient to major challenges. the center is also concerned with biological weapons and the biosecurity implications of emerging biotechnology. the center for health security gives policy recommendations to the united states government the world health organization and the un biological weapons convention. history the center for health security began as the johns hopkins center for civilian biodefense strategies ccbs in 1998 at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. d. a. henderson served as the founding director. at that time the center was the first and only academic center focused on biosecurity policy and practice. at one point around 2003 chs had become part of a new umbrella organization called the institute for global health and security at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. in november 2003 some of the leaders left johns hopkins to join the university of pittsburgh medical center upmc and launched their own center for biosecurity of upmc. this move apparently split the organization in two and it is unclear what happened to the old organization. on april 30 2013 the upmc center changed its name from center for biosecurity of upmc to upmc center for health security . this name change reflected a broadening of the scope of chs s work. in january 2017 the jhu center became part of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. its domain name changed from upmchealthsecurity.org to centerforhealthsecurity.org. funding in 2002 the center received a 1 million grant from the us federal government. before 2017 chs was heavily reliant on government funding. in january 2017 the open philanthropy project awarded a 16 million grant over three years to the center for health security. another grant of 19.5 million was awarded in september 2019. publications the center for health security publishes three online newsletters clinicians biosecurity news formerly the clinicians biosecurity network report published twice each month health security headlines a news digest published 3 times a week previously called biosecurity briefing then biosecurity news in brief starting in 2009 then biosecurity news today starting in 2010 or 2011 and finally health security headlines starting in 2013 the digest used to also be weekly until in february 2009 hsh was published daily from 2009 until late 2021 when it was changed to 3 times per week to accommodate the covid 19 update briefings published twice a week since january 2020 preparedness pulsepoints published weeklyit maintains and edits a peer reviewed journal health security which is part of the mary ann liebert publishing group. it also provides editorial oversight for the journal health security which was launched in 2003 and called biosecurity and bioterrorism biodefense strategy practice and science until 2015. chs published the blog the bifurcated needle until 2020. the open

conferences and tabletop exercises operation dark winter from june 22–23 2001 chs co hosted operation dark winter a senior level bioterrorism attack simulation involving a covert and widespread smallpox attack on the united states. atlantic storm on january 14 2005 chs helped to host atlantic storm a table top smallpox bioterrorism simulation. clade x on may 15 2018 the center hosted clade x a day long pandemic tabletop exercise that simulated a series of national security council–convened meetings of 10 us government leaders played by individuals prominent in the fields of national security or epidemic response. drawing from actual events clade x identified important policy issues and preparedness challenges that could be solved with sufficient political will and attention. these issues were designed in a narrative to engage and educate the participants and the audience. clade x was livestreamed on facebook and extensive materials from the exercise are available online. event 201 on october 18 2019 the chs partnered with the world economic forum and the bill and melinda gates foundation to host the tabletop exercise event 201 in new york city. according to the chs the exercise illustrated areas where public private partnerships will be necessary during the response to a severe pandemic in order to diminish large scale economic and societal consequences . event 201 simulated the effects of a fictional coronavirus passing to humans via infected pig farms in brazil with no possibility of a vaccine being available in the first year . the simulation ended after 18 months with 65 million deaths from the coronavirus. other see also references external links experts predicted a coronavirus pandemic years ago. now it s playing out before our eyes cnn spars
