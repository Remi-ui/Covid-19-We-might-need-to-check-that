His thesis was in the respiratory system of rats.\nYeadon worked with Salvador Moncada at the Wellcome Research Laboratories, focusing on airway hyper-responsiveness and the effects of pollutants such as Ozone and Nitrogen oxide, as well as working on drug discovery of 5-LO and COX.</p><p>He served as the chief scientist and vice-president of Pfizer's allergy and respiratory research unit in Sandwich, Kent, where he oversaw the development of drugs for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nDuring his work at Pfizer, Yeadon was responsible for the selection of targets and the progression of new molecules into human trials. His unit developed inhaled and oral NCEs that showed positive results in clinical trials for asthma, allergic rhinitis and COPD.</p><p>When Pfizer closed its Kent research facility in 2011. Yeadon, who had not worked with vaccines, then left Pfizer and with three colleagues founded the biotechnology company Ziarco which was sold to Novartis for $325 million in 2017.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"COVID-19_misinformation\">COVID-19 misinformation</span></h2>\n\n<p>Yeadon falsely claimed that the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom was \"effectively over\" in October 2020,\nthat there would be no \"second wave\" of infections,\nand that healthy people could not spread the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nHe has claimed without evidence that COVID-19 vaccines were unnecessary, unsafe, \nand could cause infertility in women.\nIn a letter to the European Medicines Agency, Yeadon and the German physician Wolfgang Wodarg called for all vaccine trials to be stopped, falsely suggesting that mRNA vaccines could target the syncytin-1 protein needed for placenta formation.\nIn an interview with political strategist Steve Bannon, Yeadon falsely asserted that children were \"50 times more likely to be killed by the COVID vaccines than the virus itself\", citing a high number of events following COVID-19 vaccination reported on the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) database. The US Centers for Disease Control, which operates the database, cautions that such reports are not verified and do not prove that vaccines caused any given adverse event.\nYeadon has also discouraged COVID-19 lockdowns and the use of face masks despite evidence for their effectiveness. \nA Telegram account under his name has promoted the unfounded claim that the vaccines cause recipients to become magnetic.\nSeveral of Yeadon's claims have been amplified on social media.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Political_activism\">Political activism</span></h2>\n<p>Yeadon founded the Liberal Spring movement in the UK, with the goal of turning the Liberal Democrats into a movement for \"Covid-sceptic beliefs\", according to <i>The Times</i>.\nHe has made financial contributions to Liberty Places, a group promising to build a community  on the African archipelago of Zanzibar for Europeans to escape COVID-19 lockdowns and vaccine mandates.\nInterviewed on Bannon’s <i>War Room</i> podcast, Yeadon indicated be would be providing support for “U.S. politicians and influencers\".</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Publications\">Publications</span></h2>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFYeadonDiamant2000\" class=\"citation book cs1\">Yeadon, Michael; Diamant, Zuzana (2000). <i>New and exploratory therapeutic agents for asthma</i>.
