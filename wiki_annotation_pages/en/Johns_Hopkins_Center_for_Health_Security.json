The Center works to protect people’s health from epidemics and pandemics and ensures that communities are resilient to major challenges. The Center is also concerned with biological weapons and the biosecurity implications of emerging biotechnology. \n</p><p>The Center for Health Security gives policy recommendations to the United States government, the World Health Organization and the UN Biological Weapons Convention.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"History\">History</span></h2>\n<p>The Center for Health Security began as the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Strategies (CCBS) in 1998 at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. D. A. Henderson served as the founding director. At that time, the Center was the first and only academic center focused on biosecurity policy and practice.\n</p><p>At one point around 2003, CHS had become part of a new umbrella organization called the Institute for Global Health and Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p><p>In November 2003, some of the leaders left Johns Hopkins to join the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC), and launched their own Center for Biosecurity of UPMC. This move apparently split the organization in two, and it is unclear what happened to the old organization.</p><p>On April 30, 2013, the UPMC Center changed its name from \"Center for Biosecurity of UPMC\" to \"UPMC Center for Health Security\". This name change reflected a broadening of the scope of CHS's work.</p><p>In January 2017, the JHU Center became part of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Its domain name changed from upmchealthsecurity.org to centerforhealthsecurity.org.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Funding\">Funding</span></h2>\n<p>In 2002, the Center received a $1 million grant from the US federal government.</p><p>Before 2017, CHS was heavily reliant on government funding.</p><p>In January 2017, the Open Philanthropy Project awarded a $16 million grant over three years to the Center for Health Security. Another grant of $19.5 million was awarded in September 2019.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Publications\">Publications</span></h2>\n<p>The Center for Health Security publishes three online newsletters:\n</p>\n<ul><li><i>Clinicians' Biosecurity News</i> (formerly the <i>Clinicians' Biosecurity Network Report</i>), published twice each month</li>\n<li><i>Health Security Headlines</i>, a news digest published 3 times a week (previously called <i>Biosecurity Briefing</i>, then <i>Biosecurity News in Brief</i> starting in 2009, then <i>Biosecurity News Today</i> starting in 2010 or 2011, and finally <i>Health Security Headlines</i> starting in 2013; the digest used to also be weekly until in February 2009, HSH was published daily from 2009 until late 2021 when it was changed to 3 times per week to accommodate the <i>COVID-19 Update</i> briefings published twice a week since January 2020)</li>\n<li><i>Preparedness Pulsepoints</i>, published weekly</li></ul><p>It maintains and edits a peer reviewed journal Health Security which is part of the Mary Ann Liebert publishing group.\n</p><p>It also provides editorial oversight for the journal <i>Health Security</i>, which was launched in 2003 and called <i>Biosecurity and Bioterrorism: Biodefense Strategy, Practice, and Science</i> until 2015.</p><p>CHS published the blog <i>The Bifurcated Needle</i> until 2020.</p><p>The Open Philanthropy Project's grant writeup of CHS noted several publications:</p>\n<ul><li><cite id=\"CITEREFBoddieWatsonAckermanGronvall2015\" class=\"citation journal cs1\">Boddie, Crystal; Watson, Matthew; Ackerman, Gary; Gronvall, Gigi Kwik (August 21, 2015). \"Assessing the bioweapons threat: Is there a foundation of agreement among experts about risk?\" <span>(PDF)</span>. <i>Science</i>. <b>349</b> (6250): 792–793. doi:10.1126/science.aab0713.
