These characteristics include efficacy, effectiveness and safety. Thirty vaccines are authorized for use by national governments, including eight approved for emergency or full use by at least one WHO-recognised stringent regulatory authority; while five are in Phase IV. 204 vaccines are undergoing clinical trials that have yet to be authorized. Nine clinical trials consider heterologous vaccination courses.\n</p><p>Thirty-three vaccines are authorized by at least one national regulatory authority for public use:</p>\n<ul><li>one DNA vaccine: ZyCoV-D</li>\n<li>two RNA vaccines: Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna</li>\n<li>twelve conventional inactivated vaccines: Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, CoronaVac, Covaxin, CoviVac, COVIran Barekat, FAKHRAVAC, Minhai-Kangtai, QazVac, Sinopharm BIBP, WIBP, Turkovac, and VLA2001.</li>\n<li>five viral vector vaccines: Sputnik Light, Sputnik V, Oxford–AstraZeneca, Convidecia, and Janssen</li>\n<li>twelve subunit vaccines: Abdala, Corbevax, COVAX-19, EpiVacCorona, MVC-COV1901, Noora, Novavax, Razi Cov Pars, Sinopharm CNBG, Soberana 02, Soberana Plus, and ZF2001.</li>\n<li>one Virus-like particle vaccine: CoVLP</li></ul><p>As of July 2021, 330 vaccine candidates were in various stages of development, with 102 in clinical research, including 30 in Phase I trials, 30 in Phase I–II trials, 25 in Phase III trials, and 8 in Phase IV development.</p>\n\n<h2><span id=\"Formulation\">Formulation</span></h2>\n<p>A wide variety of technologies are being used to formulate vaccines against COVID-19. The development and deployment of mRNA vaccines and viral vector vaccines has been outstandingly rapid and can be described as revolutionary. However, global vaccine equity against COVID-19 has not been achieved. Conventional vaccine manufacturing approaches using whole inactivated virus (WIV), protein-based subunit vaccines, and virus-like particles (VLPs) may offer advantages in the development of vaccines for use in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and in addressing vaccine access gaps.</p><p>Many vaccine candidates use adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity, as part of the delivery system or as an accompanying immune stimulant. Vaccine adjuvant formulations using aluminum salts or \"alum\" may be particularly effective for technologies using inactivated COVID-19 virus and for recombinant protein-based or vector-based vaccines.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Status\">Status</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Clinical_trials\">Clinical trials</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>The clinical trial process typically consists of three phases, each following the success of the prior phase. Trials are doubly blind in that neither the researcher nor the subject know whether they receive the vaccine or a placebo. Each phase involves randomly-selected subjects who are randomly assigned to serve either as recipients are controls:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Phase I trials test primarily for safety and preliminary dosing in healthy subjects. Dozens of subjects.</li>\n<li>Phase II trials evaluate immunogenicity, dose levels (efficacy based on biomarkers) and adverse effects. Hundreds of subjects. Sometimes Phase I and II trials are combined.</li>\n<li>Phase III trials typically involve more participants at multiple sites, include a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease (an \"interventional\" or \"pivotal\" trial), while monitoring for adverse effects at the selected dose. Safety, efficacy, and clinical endpoints may vary, including the definition of side effects, infection or amount of transmission, and whether the vaccine prevents moderate or severe infection.</li></ul><p>A clinical trial design in progress may adopt an \"adaptive design\". If accumulating data provide insights about the treatment, the endpoints or other aspects or the trial can be adjusted. Adaptive designs may shorten trial durations and use fewer subjects, possibly expediting decisions, avoiding duplication of research efforts, and enhancing coordination of design changes.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"List_of_authorized_and_approved_vaccines\">List of authorized and approved vaccines</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>National regulatory authorities have granted emergency use authorizations for twenty-two vaccines.

The authorization was extended to cover other specific groups in September 2021.</p><p>In October 2021, the FDA and the CDC authorized the use of either homologous or heterologous vaccine booster doses.</p><p><span id=\"Heterologous_prime-boost_vaccination\"></span>\n</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Heterologous_prime-boost_vaccination\">Heterologous prime-boost vaccination</span></h4>\n<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) defines heterologous prime-boost immunization as the <q>administration of two different vectors or delivery systems expressing the same or overlapping antigenic inserts.</q> A heterologous scheme can sometimes be more immunogenic than some homologous schemes.</p><p>In October 2021, the FDA and the CDC authorized the use of either homologous or heterologous vaccine booster doses.</p><p>Some experts believe that heterologous prime-boost vaccination courses can boost immunity, and several studies have begun to examine this effect. Despite the absence of clinical data on the efficacy and safety of such heterologous combinations, Canada and several European countries have recommended a heterologous second dose for people who have received the first dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine.</p><p>In February 2021, the Oxford Vaccine Group launched the Com-COV vaccine trial to investigate heterologous prime-boost courses of different COVID-19 vaccines. As of June 2021, the group is conducting two phase II studies: Com-COV and Com-COV2.</p><p>In Com-COV, the two heterologous combinations of the Oxford–AstraZeneca and Pfizer–BioNTech vaccines were compared with the two homologous combinations of the same vaccines, with an interval of 28 or 84 days between doses.</p><p>In Com-COV2, the first dose is the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine or the Pfizer vaccine, and the second dose is the Moderna vaccine, the Novavax vaccine, or a homologous vaccine equal to the first dose, with an interval of 56 or 84 days between doses.</p><p>A study in the UK is evaluating annual heterologous boosters by randomly combining the following vaccines: Oxford–AstraZeneca, Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, VLA2001, CureVac, and Janssen.</p><p>On 16 December, WHO recommendations on heterologous vaccinations suggested a general trend of increased immunogenicity when one of the doses is of an mRNA vaccine, particularly as the last dose. The immunogenicity of a homologous mRNA course is roughly equivalent to a heterologous scheme involving a vector vaccine and an mRNA vaccine. However, the WHO has emphasized the need to address many evidence gaps in heterologous regimens, including duration of protection, optimal interval between doses, influence of fractional dosing, effectiveness against variants and long-term safety.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Efficacy\">Efficacy</span></h2>\n\n<p>Vaccine efficacy is the reduction in risk of getting the disease by vaccinated participants in a controlled trial compared with the risk of getting the disease by unvaccinated participants. An efficacy of 0% means that the vaccine does not work (identical to placebo). An efficacy of 50% means that there are half as many cases of infection as in unvaccinated individuals.</p><p>COVID-19 vaccine efficacy may be adversely affected if the arm is held improperly or squeezed so the vaccine is injected subcutaneously instead of into the muscle. The CDC guidance is to not repeat doses that are administered subcutaneously.</p><p>It is not straightforward to compare the efficacies of the different vaccines because the trials were run with different populations, geographies, and variants of the virus. In the case of COVID-19 prior to the advent of the delta variant, it was thought that a vaccine efficacy of 67% may be enough to slow the pandemic, but the current vaccines do not confer sterilizing immunity, which is necessary to prevent transmission. Vaccine efficacy reflects disease prevention, a poor indicator of transmissibility of SARS‑CoV‑2 since asymptomatic people can be highly infectious. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) set a cutoff of 50% as the efficacy required to approve a COVID-19 vaccine, with the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval being greater than 30%. Aiming for a realistic population vaccination coverage rate of 75%, and depending on the actual basic reproduction number, the necessary effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine is expected to need to be at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and at least 80% to extinguish it without further measures, such as social distancing.</p><p>The observed substantial efficacy of certain mRNA vaccines even after partial (1-dose) immunization indicates a non-linear dose-efficacy relation already seen in the phase I-II study and suggests that personalization of the vaccine dose (regular dose to the elderly, reduced dose to the healthy young, additional booster dose to the immunosuppressed) might allow accelerating vaccination campaigns in settings of limited supplies, thereby shortening the pandemic, as predicted by pandemic modeling.</p><p>Ranges below are 95% confidence intervals unless indicated otherwise, and all values are for all participants regardless of age, according to the references for each of the trials. By definition, the accuracy of the estimates without an associated confidence interval is unknown publicly. Efficacy against severe COVID-19 is the most important, since hospitalizations and deaths are a public health burden whose prevention is a priority. Authorized and approved vaccines have shown the following efficacies:\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Effectiveness\">Effectiveness</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>As of August 2021, studies reported that the COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are \"highly protective against severe illness, hospitalization, and death due to COVID-19\". In comparison with fully vaccinated people, the CDC reported that unvaccinated people were 10 times more likely to be hospitalized and 11 times more likely to die.</p><p>Dr. Jeff Duchin, the Health Officer of King County, Washington found that unvaccinated people were six times more likely to test positive, 37 times more likely to be hospitalized, and 67 times more likely to die, compared to those who had been vaccinated.</p><p>CDC reported that vaccine effectiveness fell from 91% against Alpha to 66% against Delta. One expert stated that \"those who are infected following vaccination are still not getting sick and not dying like was happening before vaccination.\" By late August 2021 the Delta variant accounted for 99 percent of U.S. cases and was found to double the risk of severe illness and hospitalization for those not yet vaccinated.</p><p>A September 2021 study published in <i>The Lancet</i> found that having two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine halved the odds of long COVID.</p><p>In November 2021, a study by the ECDC estimated that 470,000 lives over the age of 60 had been saved since the start of vaccination roll-out in the European region.</p><p>On 10 December 2021, the UK Health Security Agency reported that early data indicated a 20- to 40-fold reduction in neutralizing activity for Omicron by sera from Pfizer 2-dose vaccinees relative to earlier strains. After a booster dose (usually with an mRNA vaccine), vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease was at <span><span data-sort-value=\"6999700000000000000♠\"></span>70%–75%</span>, and the effectiveness against severe disease was expected to be higher.</p><p>According to early December 2021 CDC data, \"unvaccinated adults were about 97 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than fully vaccinated people who had received boosters\".</p><p>A meta analysis looking into COVID-19 vaccine differences in immunosuppressed individuals found that people with a weakened immune system, are less able to produce neutralizing antibodies. For example, organ transplant recipients needing three vaccines to achieve seroconversion. A study on the serologic response to mRNA vaccines among patients with lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma found that one-quarter of patients did not produce measurable antibodies, varying by cancer type.</p><p>An April 2022 study published in <i>JAMA Network Open</i> found that natural immunity offered similar protection from mild and severe cases of COVID-19 as the vaccines.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Studies\">Studies</span></h4>\n<p>Real-world studies of vaccine effectiveness measure the extent to which a certain vaccine prevents infection, symptoms, hospitalization and death for the vaccinated individuals in a large population under routine conditions.</p>\n<ul><li>In Israel, among the 715,425 individuals vaccinated by the mRNA vaccines from 20 December 2020, to 28 January 2021, starting seven days after the second shot, only 317 people (0.04%) displayed mild/moderate COVID-19 symptoms and only 16 people (0.002%) were hospitalized.</li>\n<li>CDC reported that under real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness was 90% against infections regardless of symptom status; while effectiveness of partial immunization was 80%.</li>\n<li>In the UK, 15,121 health care workers from 104 hospitals who had tested negative for antibodies prior to the study, were followed by RT-PCR tests twice a week from 7 December 2020 to 5 February 2021, a study compared the positive results for the 90.7% vaccinated share of their cohort with the 9.3% unvaccinated share, and found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduced all infections (including asymptomatic), by 72% (58–86%) three weeks after the first dose and 86% (76–97%) one week after the second dose, while Alpha was dominant.</li>\n<li>In Israel a study conducted from 17 January to 6 March 2021, found that Pfizer/BioNTech reduced asymptomatic Alpha infections by 94% and symptomatic COVID-19 infections by 97%.</li>\n<li>A study among pre-surgical patients across the Mayo Clinic system in the United States, showed that mRNA vaccines were 80% protective against asymptomatic infections.</li>\n<li>A UK study found that a single dose of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is about <span><span data-sort-value=\"6999730000000000000♠\"></span>73%</span> (<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1038841319\"><span title=\"95% confidence interval\"><span><span data-sort-value=\"7001270000000000000♠\"></span>27</span>–<span><span data-sort-value=\"6999900000000000000♠\"></span>90%</span></span>) effective in people aged 70 and older.</li>\n<li>A study published in The New England Journal of Medicine finds that nearly all teenagers admitted to intensive care units because of COVID-19 were unvaccinated.</li></ul><h4><span id=\"Pregnancy_and_fertility\">Pregnancy and fertility</span></h4>\n<p>COVID vaccination does not significantly increase or reduce fertility.</p><p>A UK study found COVID vaccination is safe for pregnant women and is associated with a 15% decrease in the odds of stillbirth. Vaccination is recommended for pregnant women because pregnancy increases the risk of severe COVID. Researchers at St George's, University of London, and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists investigated 23 published studies and trials involving 117,552 vaccinated pregnant women. There was no increased risk of complications during pregnancy, the baby was protected as well as the mother. Almost all pregnant women admitted to UK hospitals with COVID were unvaccinated.</p><p>A US study of 46 079 pregnancies reported in the British Medical Journal concluded COVID vaccination was safe and did not raise the risk of preterm birth or small size babies.</p>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734\">\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734\">\n<p><br></p>\n<h3><span id=\"Critical_coverage\">Critical coverage</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>While the most immediate goal of vaccination during a pandemic is to protect individuals from severe disease, a long-term goal is to eventually eradicate it.

The potential emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant that is moderately or fully resistant to the antibody response elicited by the COVID-19 vaccines may necessitate modification of the vaccines. The emergence of vaccine-resistant variants is more likely in a highly vaccinated population with uncontrolled transmission. Trials indicate many vaccines developed for the initial strain have lower efficacy for some variants against symptomatic COVID-19. As of February 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration believed that all FDA authorized vaccines remained effective in protecting against circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Alpha_.28lineage_B.1.1.7.29\"></span><span id=\"Alpha_(lineage_B.1.1.7)\">Alpha (lineage B.1.1.7)</span></h4>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Limited evidence from various preliminary studies reviewed by the WHO indicated retained efficacy/effectiveness against disease from Alpha with the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, Pfizer–BioNTech and Novavax, with no data for other vaccines yet.

Beta was the predominant variant to occur, with post-hoc analysis indicating a vaccine efficacy of Novavax against Beta of 51.0% for HIV-negative participants.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Gamma_.28lineage_P.1.29\"></span><span id=\"Gamma_(lineage_P.1)\">Gamma (lineage P.1)</span></h4>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Limited evidence from various preliminary studies reviewed by the WHO have indicated likely retained efficacy/effectiveness against disease from Gamma with CoronaVac and Sinopharm BIBP, with no data for other vaccines yet.

There were very few detections until January 2021, but by April it had spread to at least 20 countries in all continents except Antarctica and South America. Mutations present in the spike protein in the B.1.617 lineage are associated with reduced antibody neutralization in laboratory experiments. The variant has frequently been referred to as a 'Double mutant', even though in this respect it is not unusual. the latter two of which may cause it to easily avoid antibodies. In an update on 15 April 2021, PHE designated lineage B.1.617 as a 'Variant under investigation', VUI-21APR-01. On 6 May 2021, Public Health England escalated lineage B.1.617.2 from a Variant Under Investigation to a Variant of Concern based on an assessment of transmissibility being at least equivalent to the Alpha variant.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Effect_of_neutralizing_antibodies\">Effect of neutralizing antibodies</span></h3>\n<p>One study found that the in vitro concentration (titer) of neutralizing antibodies elicited by a COVID-19 vaccine is a strong correlate of immune protection. The relationship between protection and neutralizing activity is nonlinear. A neutralization as low as <span><span data-sort-value=\"6998300000000000000♠\"></span>3%</span> (95% <abbr title=\"confidence interval\">CI</abbr>, <span><span data-sort-value=\"7000100000000000000♠\"></span>1</span>–<span><span data-sort-value=\"6999130000000000000♠\"></span>13%</span>) of the level of convalescence results in 50% efficacy against severe disease, with <span><span data-sort-value=\"6999200000000000000♠\"></span>20%</span> (<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1038841319\"><span title=\"95% confidence interval\"><span><span data-sort-value=\"7001140000000000000♠\"></span>14</span>–<span><span data-sort-value=\"6999280000000000000♠\"></span>28%</span></span>) resulting in 50% efficacy against detectable infection. Protection against infection quickly decays, leaving individuals susceptible to mild infections, while protection against severe disease is largely retained and much more durable. The observed half-life of neutralizing titers was 65 days for mRNA vaccines (Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna) during the first 4 months, increasing to 108 days over 8 months. Greater initial efficacy against infection likely results in a higher level of protection against serious disease in the long term (beyond 10 years, as seen in other vaccines such as smallpox, measles, mumps, and rubella), although the authors acknowledge that their simulations consider only protection from neutralizing antibodies and ignore other immune protection mechanisms, such as cell-mediated immunity, which may be more durable. This observation also applies to efficacy against variants and is particularly significant for vaccines with a lower initial efficacy; for example, a 5-fold reduction in neutralization would indicate a reduction in initial efficacy from 95% to 77% against a specific variant, and from a lower efficacy of 70% to 32% against that variant. For the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine, the observed efficacy is below the predicted 95% confidence interval. It is higher for Sputnik V and the convalescent response, and is within the predicted interval for the other vaccines evaluated (Pfizer–BioNTech, Moderna, Janssen, CoronaVac, Covaxin, Novavax).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Side_effects\">Side effects</span></h2>\n<p>All vaccines can have minor side effects related to the mild trauma associated with the introduction of a foreign substance into the body. These include soreness, redness, rash, and inflammation at the injection site. Other common side effects include fatigue, headache, myalgia (muscle pain), and arthralgia (joint pain) which generally resolve within a few days.</p><p>Serious adverse events that follow the administration of vaccines are of high interest to the public. It is important to recognize that the occurrence of an adverse event following vaccination does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the adverse event; the health problem may have been unrelated. Reporting of all adverse events, careful followup and statistical analysis of occurrences are required to determine whether or not a specific health problem is more likely to occur after a vaccine is administered.</p><p>More serious side effects are very rare. Before COVID-19 vaccines such as Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were authorized for use in the general population, they had to pass phase III studies involving tens of thousands of people. Any serious side effects that did not appear during that testing are likely to occur less often than ∼1 in 10,000 cases. It is important that Phase III trials be diverse, to ensure that safety results apply broadly. It is possible that side effects may affect a population that was not adequately represented during the initial testing. Pregnant women, immunocompromised people, and children are usually excluded from initial studies because they may be at higher risk. Further studies may be done to ensure their safety before vaccines are authorized for use in such populations. Subsequent examinations of the use of COVID vaccines in pregnant people and in children have shown similar outcomes to the general population and do not suggest greater risk for these groups.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Reporting_of_adverse_events\">Reporting of adverse events</span></h3>\n<p>Most countries operate some form of adverse effects reporting scheme, for example Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System in the United States and the Yellow Card Scheme in the United Kingdom. In some of these, the data is open to public scrutiny. For example, the UK publishes a weekly summary report. Concerns have been raised regarding both over- and under-reporting of adverse effects.\nIn other cases, as in Israel, information is collected internal to the health system. Given differences in population size, vaccines used, reporting systems, recommendations and potentially population characteristics from country to country, adverse reactions are discussed below by country.\n</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Israel\">Israel</span></h3>\n<p>In Israel, as of 24 May 2021, nearly 5 million people (over 55% of the population) had received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine (Pfizer). A nation-wide study published on 21 September 2021 reported on the safety of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, based on data from Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest health care organization in Israel. Adverse events were identified from diagnostic information in the CHS database. Vaccinated and unvaccinated persons were matched according to sociodemographic and clinical variables, and adverse events were studied following both vaccination and SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p><p>The BNT162b2 vaccine was not associated with an elevated risk for most adverse events, with the exception of myocarditis which was statistically more likely to occur following vaccination. This result (1 to 5 events per 100,000 persons) should be considered in the context of adverse events following SARS-CoV-2 infection, which were even greater (11.0 events per 100,000 persons). Analyses performed based on data collected in 2021 suggested that risk of many other serious adverse events also substantially increased following SARS-CoV-2 infection, while a later study found no increase in either myocarditis or pericarditis in adults recovering from COVID-19.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"UK\">UK</span></h3>\n<p>As of 6 April 2022, three COVID-19 vaccines are in use in the UK: the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, and the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. In the UK's Yellow Card system, suspected adverse reactions (ADRs) are known as \"Yellow Cards\". Over 100,000,000 first and second doses of vaccine have been administered in the UK, with 2 to 5 Yellow Cards reported per 1,000 doses of vaccine administered. These overwhelmingly represent temporary injection-site reactions such as a sore arm or fatigue, which are common to all types of vaccines and not specific to COVID vaccines.</p><p>There are rare reports of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, to all three forms of the vaccine. On the basis of this data, people who have a previous history of severe allergic reactions to the ingredients of a vaccine are advised not to receive it.</p><p>There are rare reports of transverse myelitis (TM), an inflammation of the spinal cord, which may be more likely to occur with the AstraZeneca vaccine. Patients who experience transverse myelitis after a first dose of AstraZeneca vaccine are advised not to receive a second dose of this vaccine.</p><p>Extremely rare occurrences of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a type of blood clot in the brain, and of thrombocytopenia, low platelet levels, have also been associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine. These can potentially be fatal, and those experiencing certain symptoms (e.g. severe headache, chest or stomach pain) should see a doctor immediately. Anyone who experienced blood clotting or platelet issues after receiving AstraZeneca should not have further doses of this vaccine.</p><p>Reports of myocarditis and pericarditis are very rare but have more frequently been reported following vaccination with the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. This may occur more frequently in younger males, and can be fatal: patients are advised to be aware of symptoms for myocarditis and pericarditis and seek medical help if they occur. Estimates of the number of extra cases of myocarditis that occur following vaccination range from 27 to 188 per million people. To put that in context, an estimated 1,500 cases of myocarditis per million patients are associated with COVID-19 infections.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"USA\">USA</span></h3>\n<p>As of 18 April 2022, three vaccines were authorized for use in the United States by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA): Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty), Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (Spikevax), and Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. As of that date, approximately 571 million doses had been administered in the US, with Pfizer being the most frequently used (336,252,416), then Moderna (214,191,561) and then Janssen (18,652,610). The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is used in the United States by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to collect reports of adverse events following vaccination. Post-marketing safety data has also been accumulated using the CDC's multi-site Vaccine Safety Datalink system, which allows researchers to analyze rare or severe adverse events in defined groups.</p><p>One less-frequent side effect (that generally occurs in less than 1 in 1,000 people) is hypersensitivity (allergy) to one or more of the vaccine's ingredients, which in some rare cases may cause anaphylaxis. The CDC recommended that those receiving vaccines be observed immediately after vaccination, and treated if showing signs of anaphylaxis.</p><p>According to a June 2021 statement from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cases of myocarditis and pericarditis had been reported in about 13 per million young people (mostly in males and mostly over the age of 16), in association with the mRNA vaccines. According to reports at the time, the recovery from these side effects was quick in most individuals, following treatment and rest. However, an independent analysis published in April 2022 found that the true rate of myopericarditis in the 12-39 age range was \"markedly higher\" than had been previously reported to U.S. advisory committees, owing to inconsistent or incomplete reporting among Vaccine Safety Datalink facilities.</p><p>Rare cases of Thrombosis (formation of blood clots in the blood vessels) in combination with Thrombocytopenia (low levels of blood platelets), referred to as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) occurred following Janssen vaccine injections at a rate of about 7 per 1 million in vaccinated women ages 18–49 years old; and less often for other populations. On 16 December 2021, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) be used rather than the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in persons over 18 years, unless use of mRNA vaccine was counterindicated for the person.</p><p>Cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a neurological disorder involving damage to nerve cells and potentially life-threatening paralysis, have been reported after receipt of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine. On 16 December 2021, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) be used rather than the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine in persons over 18 years, unless use of mRNA vaccine was counter indicated for the person.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"European_Union\">European Union</span></h3>\n<p>Four COVID-19 vaccines have been approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in Europe: BNT162b2 (Pfizer), Spikevax (Moderna), ChAdOx1 (Astrazeneca), and Ad26.COV2-S (Janssen).\nSimilar recommendations regarding the possibility of severe reactions are reported from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).</p><p>In addition, the EU is investigating other possible adverse reactions. Erythema multiforme has been reported as a possible side effect of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccination. A causal role for the vaccine has not yet been proven. Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) is also being reviewed. The EMA has recommended that people who have had capillary leak syndrome should not use the Janssen COVID vaccine.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hong_Kong\">Hong Kong</span></h3>\n<p>As of 13 July 2022, three COVID-19 vaccines have been approved for use in Hong Kong: CoronaVac (Sinovac Biotech), Comirnaty (Pfizer–BioNTech), and the Fosun-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Adverse events are assessed according to the 2019 edition of the \"Causality assessment of an adverse event following immunization (AEFI)\" published by the World Health Organization.</p><p>A population cohort study found a significant increase in risk of myocarditis following the second dose of Comirnaty in male adolescents between June and September 2021.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734\">"}]}}
