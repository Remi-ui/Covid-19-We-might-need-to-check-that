The origins of the virus have subsequently led to an increase in acts and displays of Sinophobia, as well as prejudice, xenophobia, discrimination, violence, and racism against people of East Asian and Southeast Asian descent and appearance around the world. With the spread of the pandemic and formation of hotspots, such as those in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, discrimination against people from these hotspots has been reported.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Background\">Background</span></h2>\n<p>In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical locations, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Zika virus, but in 2015, the World Health Organization introduced recommendations to avoid this practice, to reduce stigma. In accordance with this policy, the WHO recommended the official name \"COVID-19\" in February 2020.</p><p>In early coverage of the outbreak, some news sources associated the virus with China in a manner that contributed to stigma. The journal <i>Nature</i> later published an apology for this type of coverage. However, even after the majority of politicians had switched to avoiding stigmatizing language when referring to the virus, a minority continued.</p><p>Following the progression of the outbreak to new hotspot countries, people from Italy (the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19) were also subjected to suspicion and xenophobia, as were people from hotspots in other countries. Discrimination against Muslims in India escalated after public health authorities identified an Islamic missionary (Tablighi Jamaat) group's gathering in New Delhi in early March 2020 as a source of spread. As of late April 2020, Paris had seen riots break out over police treatment of marginalised ethnic groups during the then in-place lockdown. Racism and xenophobia towards southern and south east Asians increased in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf.  In China, some people of African descent  were evicted from their homes and told to leave China within 24 hours, due to disinformation that they and other foreigners were spreading the virus. This racism and xenophobia was criticised by some foreign governments, diplomatic corps, and the Chinese ambassador to Zimbabwe.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Africa\">Africa</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Cameroon\">Cameroon</span></h3>\n<p>The US embassy in Yaoundé issued a travel warning to US citizens amid reports of \"...<span> </span>verbal and online harassment, stone throwing, and banging on vehicles occupied by expatriates\". Some residents of Cameroon thought that Europeans and Americans brought COVID to Africa.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Egypt\">Egypt</span></h3>\n<p>According to the Embassy of Japan in Cairo, store clerks have been hesitating to serve Japanese customers, and \"corona\" has also become a new slur with which to abuse Japanese people on the street.</p><p>On 10 March 2020, an Uber driver was arrested after a viral video showing the driver forcibly removing his Chinese passenger at a highway in Cairo's Maadi district on suspicion of having the virus. In the video, a voice is heard in the video jokingly shouting \"The first coronavirus case in Egypt!\" and the same voice then tells the driver \"May God support you, Hajji! Throw him out!\". The incident has sparked outrage among Egyptians after the video was uploaded. Some Egyptians visited the Chinese man in his hotel and expressed an apology to him for the incident, widely condemned in the local media as an act of bullying and racism.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ethiopia\">Ethiopia</span></h3>\n<p>Violence towards foreigners has been reported amidst the pandemic, with some locals attacking foreigners on social media by publishing photos of them and linking them to the coronavirus.

Additionally, one of the earliest reactions of the South African government with regard to COVID-19 prevention was to build a forty-kilometer (25<span> </span>mi) fence on the border with Zimbabwe. This action was intended to \"ensure that no undocumented or infected persons cross into the country\", according to Public Works Minister Patricia de Lille. In February 2021, the Director of The Jesuit Institute South Africa, Father Russell Pollitt, criticized as potentially xenophobic Health Minister Dr. Zweli Mkhize's announcement that COVID-19 vaccine distribution would be limited to only South African citizens.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Asia\">Asia</span></h2>\n<h3><span id=\"Bangladesh\">Bangladesh</span></h3>\n<p>The Bangladeshi government has sent dozens of Rohingya refugees, who had remained stranded at sea for several weeks, to Bhasan Char, an uninhabited island in the estuary of the Meghna river.

Multiple hotels purportedly refused to check-in a Wuhan tour guide after she returned to Hangzhou from Singapore with one of them calling the police to give her a health check and asking the police to quarantine her. Amidst these incidents, various cities and prefectures outside of Hubei adopted resettlement measures for Hubei people in their region such as designated hotel accommodation for visitors from the province. In Zhengding, Jingxing and Luquan of Shijiazhuang City, the local governments rewarded anyone who reported those who had been to Wuhan, but not recorded in official documents at least 1,000 yuan RMB. In Meizhou, residents reporting people entering from Hunan were awarded thirty face masks.</p><p>It was reported that on a scheduled 27 January China Southern Airlines flight from Nagoya to Shanghai, some Shanghainese travellers refused to board with 16 others from Wuhan. Two of the Wuhan travellers were unable to board due to a fever while the Shanghainese on the spot alleged that the others had taken medicine to bypass the temperature check. One of the Wuhan tourists protested on Weibo, \"are they really my countrymen?\" which a Shanghai tourist who was purportedly at the scene replied that they did it to protect Shanghai from the virus. Many netizens criticized the Wuhan tourists for travelling with a fever, although some also called for understanding and for Shanghainese not to regionally discriminate.</p><p>On 1 April, three Americans cut in line at a medical facility in Qingdao, Shandong province. When confronted, one American claimed that there were eight million Chinese in America and that he would tell them all to get out. The three Americans were allowed to skip the line and the staff told the ones who confronted them that it was their way of showing respect to foreigners.</p><p>In March and April 2020, media outlets reported instances of xenophobia towards foreigners, although according to <i>The Globe and Mail</i> on 10 April, Chinese officials denied the existence of any such discrimination within China. It has been attributed to fears of a second wave of the coronavirus, although the Chinese vice-foreign minister noted that ninety percent of imported COVID-19 cases were PRC nationals returning from overseas. According to <i>The Telegraph</i>, foreigners are being barred from hotels, supermarkets, and restaurants, while others have had their visas cancelled and reentry into China barred. <i>The Guardian</i> reported on 29 March of foreigners being shouted at by local residents, avoided in public places, and sometimes scolded as \"foreign trash\". Shanghaiist has referenced stories of foreigner misbehaviour circulating on the Chinese internet as playing a role in the increased xenophobia. A comic posted on Weibo depicts people in hazmat suits disinfecting foreigners and throwing them in waste bins.</p><p>In April 2020, several reports emerged in Guangzhou of African nationals being evicted from their homes by local police and told to leave, with no place to sleep, amidst some recent Chinese news articles negatively reporting on Nigerians in the city. The reports of discrimination created controversy in Africa damaging Sino-African relations, and sparked a diplomatic crisis, with African governments and diplomats speaking out against the incidents in Guangzhou. The Nigerian legislator Oloye Akin Alabi posted a video of his confronting the PRC's ambassador Zhou Pingjian over the alleged mistreatment of Nigerians in the city. The governments of Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda have also asked for explanations from the PRC government, and the African Union Commission invited the PRC ambassador to the African Union to discuss the mistreatment allegations. The African ambassadors summarised the complaints in an official protest letter demanding the cessation of reported ejection from hotels or apartments, forced testing and quarantine, the seizure of passports, and threats of visa revocation, arrest or deportation of Africans particularly in the Guangdong province. In response, Chinese authorities issued measures discouraging Guangzhou businesses and rental houses from refusing people based on race or nationality and encouraged foreigners to report discrimination to a 24-hour hotline. Some locals coordinated food donations and listed available hotels online to African residents.</p><p>China initially placed land mines in selected regions along its border with Myanmar, which were later replaced by a barbed wire fence along 1000 km of the Myanmese border, for the stated goal of reducing cross-border COVID-19 infections. Other government sources suggested that pandemic restrictions were secondary to a desire to block the transmission of foreign ideas across the once-porous border region, citing a desire to specifically restrict the flow of Christianity and Buddhism into China.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Hong_Kong\">Hong Kong</span></h3>\n<p>More than a hundred restaurants in Hong Kong have turned away customers from mainland China, with one restaurant demanding that a customer produce a Hong Kong identity card to prove they were not from the mainland. Tenno Ramen, a Japanese noodle restaurant in Hung Hom, refused to serve mainland Chinese customers. The restaurant said on Facebook, \"We want to live longer. We want to safeguard local customers. Please excuse us.\" Another example is Kwong Wing Catering, a pro-2019–20 Hong Kong protests restaurant chain, which announced on Facebook on 28 January 2020 that it would serve only English- or Cantonese-speaking customers (no Mandarin-speakers customers allowed) since the government did not implement a border closure against mainland China. However, Mandarin is also the common tongue in Taiwan, so the said Facebook post was then updated a day later to clarify that they welcome Taiwanese customers.</p><p>Many protesters in Hong Kong have reportedly insisted on calling COVID-19 the \"Chinese Virus\" or \"Chinese coronavirus\".

He later argued this was \"not racist at all\" after lawmakers including Elizabeth Warren raised objections about the statement. Trump also tweeted, on 23 March 2020, that the coronavirus was not Asian Americans' fault and their communities should be protected. CNN commentators Chris Cuomo and Jim Acosta also criticized the use of the term \"Wuhan Virus\" and \"Chinese Virus\", although other CNN anchors had used those terms in the past. Trump also brushed off the alleged use of the derogatory term \"Kung Flu\" by a White House official to refer to COVID-19 when asked by a reporter during a media session on 18 March 2020. Eventually he pulled back on the \"Chinese Virus\" name due to Asian communities facing increased number of racist taunts and incidents as the illness spread across the U.S. However, at his Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally on June 20, Trump referred to the virus as \"Kung Flu\".</p><p>Then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo referred to the virus as the \"Wuhan Virus\" and said that there was \"a significant amount of evidence\" it emerged from the Wuhan Institute of Virology and blamed the Chinese Communist Party for posing \"a substantial threat to our health and way of life.\"</p><p>In response to the growing anti-Chinese sentiment, several media outlets and individuals began suggesting that it was not useful to blame Chinese people for the pandemic, and that there was a distinction between the people of China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), accused by some of covering up and mishandling the pandemic. A petition to use the name 'CCP virus' was launched with the White House on 20 March 2020.\n</p><p>On 23 March 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) New York City office issued an alert reporting that extremists were encouraging one another to intentionally spread the coronavirus to police officers and members of the Jewish community, if they contracted it. That same day, the FBI foiled a terrorist plot by a white supremacist to use a car bomb to blow up a Missouri hospital overflowing with COVID-19 patients, with the man having referenced far-right conspiracy theories that the virus was \"engineered by Jews\" online before he was shot and killed in an altercation with FBI agents.

Two months earlier, President Bolsonaro had selected a former missionary from New Tribes to head the government agency responsible for protecting these tribes.</p><p>According to Brazilian journalist Gabriel Leão, Asian Brazilians have not been impacted as much by racism and discrimination as other Asian communities in the Northern Hemisphere, particularly those in the United States, United Kingdom, and other European countries. However, Leão expressed concern that anti-Asian sentiment will increase in Brazil as well, because of how Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro tried to use the pandemic as an opportunity to attack China, similar to Donald Trump. In early 2020, Bolsonaro reportedly became convinced that COVID-19 was \"part of a Chinese government scheme to expand its global power\".\n</p><p>According to Leão, there have already been reports of Brazilians of Asian descent suffering from pandemic-related harassment, for example, being told to \"go back to their country\" or being accused of \"spreading the virus\". He himself has heard strangers in Brazil casually curse the \"Chinese virus\". Chinese Brazilians in particular have been dealing with increased occurrences of discrimination in 2020, for example being told to \"go back to China\", \"watch out for sellers\", or to \"get out, Chinese\". One Chinese Brazilian in particular was told \"Put the fucking mask on, you piece of shit. These pests come to our country to kill us. Go back to your country, you animal\" when he tried to take off his mask to drink water at a clinic in Rio de Janeiro at the end of 2020.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Responses\">Responses</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned racism against Chinese Canadians while attending a Lunar New Year festival in Toronto on 29 January 2020.
