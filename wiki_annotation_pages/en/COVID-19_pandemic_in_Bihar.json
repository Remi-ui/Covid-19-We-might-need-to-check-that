The camps were closed down on 15 June and the last registration for institutional quarantining took place on 1 June. The reason given for this was that reportedly the last batch of migrant workers came back on the 1st of June and the ones who came to Bihar after that aren't necessary returnee migrant workers. The other reasons was that most of these camps operated out of schools, which needed to be vacated as the government planned to reopen schools in July. As of 14 June, there were 288 Block Quarantine Camps with a total of 15,33,392 persons registered for quarantining.</p><p>While operational, these camps provided three meals a day to them, as well as a minimum financial assistance of â‚¹1,000.
