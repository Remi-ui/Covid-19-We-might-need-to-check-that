On April 1st Governor Ron DeSantis declared a public health emergency. There is evidence, however, that community spread of COVID-19 began in Florida much earlier, perhaps as early as the first week of January, with as many as 171 people in Florida who had shown symptoms now identified with COVID-19, prior to receiving confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. By March 11, the CDC saw evidence to conclude that community spread of the virus had occurred within the state. On April 1, 2020, Governor DeSantis issued an executive order to restrict activities within the state to those deemed as essential services.</p><p>On September 25, 2020, Florida lifted all remaining capacity restrictions on businesses, while also prohibiting local governments from enforcing public health orders with fines, or restricting restaurants to less than 50% capacity. By late fall, confirmed cases of COVID-19 rose again in Florida, with over 10,000 new cases per day reported on over half the days of December 2020 and 13 of the first 14 days of 2021.  21,015 new cases were reported for December 31 on January 2, the highest daily report for 2020.  On July 31, 2021, Florida recorded 21,683 new cases in one day, the highest at any time in the pandemic, driven by delta variant.</p><p>As of September 16, 2021, the Florida Department of Health had reported 3,485,163 COVID-19 cases and 51,240 deaths among residents of the state.  As of December 2021, among all US states Florida had the eighth-highest per capita case rate.  As of July 2021, one in every five new COVID-19 cases recorded in the United States came from Florida.  Since the start of the pandemic approximately 1 of every 402 Florida residents has died of COVID-19. Vaccines have been administered in Florida since December 14, 2020. As of May 2, 2021, Florida has administered 15,488,105 COVID-19 vaccine doses with 42% of the population having received at least one shot and 30% of the population being fully vaccinated.</p><p>Since 2021, Florida has placed restrictions on the use of COVID-19 mitigations by local governments and private businesses; the state has expressly prohibited vaccination mandates applying to COVID-19 vaccines, \"vaccine passports\", and an executive order voiding all remaining COVID-19 public health orders, and restricting any further order by local governments, was signed by Governor DeSantis in May 2021. DeSantis also controversially prohibited local governments and school boards from mandating that face masks be worn at school—a policy which has resulted in legal disputes.\n</p><p>As of Tuesday, April 19, 2022 more than 14,342,000 people are fully vaccinated in Florida. The state has logged at least 5,888,264 cases and 73,738 deaths since the pandemic began in March 2020.</p>\n\n\n<h2><span id=\"Timeline\">Timeline</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1097763485\"><link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1097763485\"><h3><span id=\"Initial_cases_.28January.E2.80.93May_2020.29\"></span><span id=\"Initial_cases_(January–May_2020)\">Initial cases (January–May 2020)</span></h3>\n<p><b>February 29, 2020:</b> Florida state health laboratories in Tampa, Jacksonville, and Miami are able to process COVID-19 tests locally rather than sending them to federal labs, cutting processing time from 3–5 days to 1–2 days.</p><p><b>March 1:</b> Florida becomes the tenth state to confirm its first COVID-19 cases: one in Manatee County, and one in Hillsborough County with a woman who had recently returned from Italy.</p><p><b>March 3:</b> The Florida Department of Health sets up a 24-hour COVID-19 hotline.

The health department counts only Florida residents and organizes the data by the person's place of residence (to avoid double-counting); in contrast, the medical examiners count anyone who dies in the state, which includes visitors. The health department's analysis causes several days of reporting delay, which is a further reason it is difficult to compare the numbers. In response to the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> article, Florida officials stopped the release of the medical examiners' list, saying that it should be reviewed and possibly redacted, but did not publicly specify what exactly they wanted to redact.</p><p><b>April 17:</b> DeSantis allows some Florida beaches to reopen if done safely</p><p><b>April 18</b> It is announced that schools would remain closed for the remainder of the semester.</p><p><b>April 20:</b> The Florida Department of Economic Opportunities releases a dashboard showing that 1.5 million unemployment claims were made during the last month.

Jones claimed that the Department of Health wanted data on Florida's coronavirus dashboard changed to support Governor Ron DeSantis' plans to resume economic activity. She further contended that she was fired for refusing to alter the information. A statement from DeSantis' office denied this, instead claiming that she was fired for insubordination and unilateral decision-making regarding her dashboard additions. DeSantis added that Jones contradicted state epidemiologists. (One year later, Jones was granted whistleblower status, which will provide her with the right to confidentiality while the circumstances of her termination are investigated.)  The Office of Inspector General later found her claims to be unsubstantiated or unfounded; those she accused were exonerated of any misconduct.</p><p><b>May 17:</b> Monroe County commissioners vote for a mask mandate that requires all employees and customers of businesses to wear masks.</p><p><b>May 18:</b> Broward County and Miami-Dade County enter Phase One of reopening.</p><p><b>May 22:</b> The Miami Beach City Commission votes that Miami-Dade hotels and beaches reopen by June 1, but that did not happen.</p><p><b>May 27:</b> Ocean Drive on Miami Beach is closed off to allow restaurants to expand their seating.

On March 17, he ordered all bars and nightclubs to be closed for 30 days, extended school closures to April 15, and cancelled state-mandated school testing.</p><p>By the third week of the pandemic's presence in Florida, DeSantis began attracting criticism for the state's slow response to the pandemic, particularly for deferring beach closings to local governments during spring break while vacationers continued to congregate. The <i>Miami Herald</i><span>'</span>s editorial board wrote an editorial condemning DeSantis' inaction in requesting help from the federal government, while noting his vocal support of U.S. president Donald Trump. Speculation mounted that DeSantis' decision not to lock down the state was influenced by business interests, instead of health experts. Business lobbyists, including the Florida Chamber of Commerce, urged the Governor not to \"take drastic measures that might shut down the state's economy.\" On March 27, more than 900 health care workers signed a letter asking DeSantis to order citizens to shelter-in-place, and take other measures to slow the spread of COVID-19. A similar letter written by Doctors for America was signed by 500 health care professionals a few days earlier.</p><p>On March 27, DeSantis expanded a previous order requiring airline travelers from New York City to self-quarantine for fourteen days to include people who enter from Louisiana via Interstate 10.</p><p>On March 28, an emergency alert was sent to cell phones throughout Florida from the state's Surgeon General, Dr. Scott A.

He stated that the order would remain in effect at least until the middle of May.</p><p>On April 1, DeSantis issued a stay-at-home order for the entire state, effective for 30 days, after a call with President Trump. This followed criticism from experts that more strict measures were necessary to contain the virus.</p><p>On April 9, while discussing the possibility of sending children back to school, DeSantis said, \"I don't think nationwide there's been a single fatality under 25.\" (This was not true; by this point, several Americans under 25 had died of COVID-19.) DeSantis suggested that the flu was more dangerous to this age group.</p><p>On June 1, DeSantis extended the statewide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures another 30 days, lasting through July 1. Residents of Florida who receive unemployment payments were confused in mid-June when the state of Florida switched their payments from weekly to bi-weekly, with no apparent notice.</p><p>On June 5, DeSantis issued an executive order implementing \"Phase 2\" of a reopening plan outside of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties, allowing some businesses (such as bars, pubs, and indoor venues such as arcades, bowling alleys, cinemas, and concert venues) to expand to 50% capacity, and personal care services to resume operations. The order recommended against gatherings of more than 50 people.</p><p>On June 16, DeSantis said 260 Orlando International Airport workers tested positive for COVID-19. He also said that the increase of cases was due to an increase of testing and that even though cases are increasing, \"they are not rolling back.\" Orlando airport said this was false, and that only 2 out of 500 employees tested positive.</p><p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo considered the idea of quarantining people who travel from Florida to New York due to concern of rising COVID-19 cases in Florida. They monitored for an influx of cases of people traveling from Florida. On June 20, DeSantis said that he was cracking down on restaurants not practicing strict social distancing guideline. He also noted that the new cases were trending in the younger generation, with much of the cases being people between the ages of 20 and 35 years old.</p><p>On June 23, DeSantis said that Florida bars and restaurants would be liable to lose their liquor licenses if they violate the state's social distancing guidelines. 13 employees and at least 28 patrons of The Knight's Pub in Orlando tested positive for COVID-19, resulting in The Knight's Pub losing their liquor license. Due to the increase of cases, some hospitals, like Palm Beach Gardens and JFK Medical Center, reported having no open ICU beds. However, State Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees told hospitals to only report COVID-19 patients as ICU cases if they required ICU level of care, since some ICUs were being used to simply isolate COVID-19 patients from other hospital patients, and to report non-ICU-level care cases as COVID-hospitalized cases. The same day, Florida banned liquor sales at bars that do not offer substantial food menus. Strip clubs remained open.</p><p>As of June 26, 660 inmates and 24 staff at the Homestead Correctional Institution tested positive for COVID-19, and 23 deaths have been accounted for at the Institution due to the virus.</p><p>On September 10, 2020, the state rescinded the executive order prohibiting alcohol sales at bars.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Prohibitions_on_mitigations\">Prohibitions on mitigations</span></h4>\n<p>On September 25, Governor DeSantis announced Phase 3, which lifted all capacity restrictions on most businesses. In addition, municipalities are prohibited from collecting fines for violations of local health orders, and may not restrict restaurants to less than 50% capacity unless they receive approval from the state; they must provide justification for the decision, and detail any possible economic impact.</p><p>From April 2021, DeSantis has signed multiple executive orders designed to prohibit the use of COVID-19 mitigations, citing alleged infringements of personal freedoms. On April 2, 2021, Governor DeSantis signed an executive order prohibiting any business from requiring proof of vaccination or recovery (\"vaccine passports\") as a prerequisite for entry or the provision of services, punishable by fine of $5,000 per-instance.</p><p>On May 3, 2021, DeSantis signed an executive order officially rescinding the state of emergency and all COVID-19-related public health orders. This order superseded all local public health orders, and also prohibited municipalities from enacting any further public health order related to COVID-19. That same day, he signed a bill prohibiting vaccine passports and limiting other COVID-19 mitigation measures such as mask mandates. On July 30, DeSantis signed an executive order prohibiting municipalities and school boards from mandating that masks be worn in schools.</p><p>In July 2021, Norwegian Cruise Line sued the Surgeon General of Florida, arguing that the prohibition of vaccine mandates \"poses imminent, substantial, irreparable harms\" to the company, and prevented it from being able to ensure the health and safety of its passengers and crew. The DeSantis administration argued that the company \"has made the disappointing and unlawful choice to join the CDC in discriminating against children and other individuals who cannot be vaccinated or who have opted not to be vaccinated for reasons of health, religion, or conscience.\" On August 8, District Judge Kathleen M. Williams issued a preliminary injunction against the prohibition, arguing that it \"fails to provide a valid evidentiary, factual, or legal predicate\", and that \"documentary proof of vaccination will expedite passengers' entry into virtually every single country and port where Plaintiffs intend to sail.\"</p><p>On November 18, 2021, DeSantis signed four bills, passed by the Florida Legislature the previous day, that, among other actions, limited vaccine mandates by businesses and government entities.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"County_and_local_responses\">County and local responses</span></h3>\n\n<h4><span id=\"Schools\">Schools</span></h4>\n<p>On June 10, 2020, it was announced that Broward County and Palm Beach County were considering twice-a-week school for the fall. On June 16, 2020, Broward County announced that schools would reopen on August 16, 2020, with hybrid learning, both in-person and online education.</p><p>On July 6, 2020, the Florida Department of Education ordered all public schools to reopen in person. This was challenged by the Florida Education Association (FEA). On August 24, 2020, the Second Judicial Circuit Court issued an injunction against the order. The case was appealed to the First District Court of Appeal, which ruled in mid October 2020 in favor of the reopening order. A rehearing was requested in late October 2020 but ultimately the FEA voluntarily dismissed the case on December 23, 2020.</p><p>From August 10 to December 21, 2020, cases of school-related COVID-19 included 25,094 among students and 9,630 among staff members. Of all 2,809,553 registered students, there were 101 hospitalizations and no deaths. Among staff members, there were 219 hospitalizations and 13 deaths. Contact tracing revealed 10,092 positive cases in people who had close-contact in a school setting with people who had school-related COVID-19. 62 of the 67 school districts had at least one case, with a total of 695 school-based outbreaks. 28 schools in 12 districts closed temporarily because of COVID-19.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Masks\">Masks</span></h4>\n\n<p>On June 23, Carlos Gimenez, Mayor of Miami-Dade County, said police would be enforcing rules concerning wearing masks in public places and social distancing. On June 25, Palm Beach County started enforcing a mask mandate. On June 26, Key West implemented a mandatory mask law, making it punishable either by citation or a $500 fine, and they canceled 4 July fireworks. At the end of June, the commissioners for St. Johns County voted 4–1 against requiring masks indoors. Less than two weeks later, one of the St. Johns commissioners who had voted against masks was hospitalized in critical condition with a COVID-19 diagnosis.</p><p>In August 2020, Marion County, Florida's sheriff's office announced that deputies and visitors to the police stations would be forbidden from wearing masks.</p><p>Beginning September 25, 2020, as part of an executive order from the governor which coincided with \"Phase 3\" of reopening the state, local governments are not able to collect fines from individuals who violate local COVID-19-related health orders.</p>\n<h5><span id=\"Prohibition_of_mask_mandates_in_schools\">Prohibition of mask mandates in schools</span></h5>\n<p>On July 30, 2021, Governor DeSantis signed an executive order that prohibits schools and school boards from mandating masks, citing a desire to preserve personal freedoms and parents' rights to choose. Schools that mandate masks, thereby violating this order, may lose their state funding. Additionally, the governor's office threatened to \"withhold\" the paychecks of individual superintendents and school board members who \"intentionally defy\" the order.</p><p>The order faced wide criticism, due to the fact that there were no vaccines approved by the FDA for children younger than 12 at the time, and that the CDC had recommended the wearing of masks by all school students and faculty due to Delta variant. A number of school districts announced that they would defy the order and mandate masks; Alberto M. Carvalho, superintendent of Miami-Dade County Public Schools, stated that \"At no point shall I allow my decision to be influenced by a threat to my paycheck; a small price to pay considering the gravity of this issue and the potential impact to the health and well-being of our students and dedicated employees.\" Two lawsuits against the order were filed on August 6, alleging that it violates provisions in the state constitution which prescribe that \"adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure, and high quality system of free public schools\".</p><p>On August 10, White House press secretary Jen Psaki described Florida schools as having shown \"boldness\" and \"courage\" in their actions, and stated that the Biden administration was looking into ways to help \"support districts and schools as they try to follow the science, do the right thing and save lives\", including the possibility of distributing funding allocated to Florida under the American Rescue Plan.</p><p>On August 12, DeSantis's press secretary Christina Pushaw told the <i>Miami Herald</i> that the Governor could not actually withhold pay from officials who willfully violate the executive order since they are not state employees, and because they might \"take funding from other needs in their own district\" in order to cover their salaries. She argued that \"those officials should own their decision — and that means owning the consequences of their decisions rather than demanding students, teachers, and school staff to foot the bill for their potential grandstanding.\" During a ten-day period in late August and early September, 15 staff members in the Miami-Dade County public schools died of COVID-19.</p><p>On August 27, the state's Second Judicial Circuit ruled that the Florida Department of Education could not interfere with local mask mandates. However, on September 10, the First District Court of Appeal reversed the decision, reinstating Governor DeSantis's policy that masks should always be optional. The same day, the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, suspecting that a statewide ban on local mask mandates may violate the rights of students with disabilities, announced its intent to probe DeSantis's policy. On October 7, the Republican-led state Board of Education voted to penalize eight school districts for requiring masks.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Curfews\">Curfews</span></h4>\n<p>Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez signed order to close beaches starting Friday, July 3, 2020, and ending Tuesday, July 7, with a limit of gatherings to 50 people. Broward County and Palm Beach County soon after followed Miami-Dade's example and decided to close their beaches for 4 July as well.</p><p>On July 2, 2020, Mayor Gimenez ordered a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also ordered all on-site dining to close from 12:01 a.m. to 6 a.m. daily at restaurants with seating for more than eight people. Both orders were to last until further notice.</p><p>On March 20, 2021, the City of Miami Beach declared a state of emergency and an 8 p.m. curfew due to overcrowded streets during spring break.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Contact_tracing\">Contact tracing</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n<p>On July 7, 2020, DeSantis announced that Florida had received federal grants under the CARES Act to hire contact tracers. According to the state's daily report for July 6 out of 213,794 confirmed cases, over 40% had still not been contacted. Contact tracing has met with challenges as contact tracers have been unable to track the spread at crowded parties because young people have not wanted to share the information with contact tracers.</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Statistics\">Statistics</span></h2>\n<p>During the months of June, July, and August 2020, the number of COVID-19 cases in Florida increased over eleven-fold, from 56,830 on June 1 to 631,040 on September 1. COVID-19 deaths lag by several weeks behind case counts, but by the end of July, Florida set new death records on four consecutive days, culminating in 257 deaths on July 31.

Universal Parks &amp; Resorts also announced that Universal Orlando Resort would close from March 15 until at least the end of the month, also later announcing that the parks and resorts would stay closed until May 31. Other theme parks in Florida such as SeaWorld Orlando, Legoland Florida, and Busch Gardens Tampa Bay also decided to close from March 13 until further notice.</p><p>Despite the increase of COVID-19 cases in Florida, theme parks reopened in mid-July. Although a major exception to this would be Legoland Florida which reopened on June 1. On July 11, Disney reopened Animal Kingdom and Magic Kingdom. Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios reopened on July 15.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Elder_care_facilities\">Elder care facilities</span></h3>\n<p>On March 2, AARP warned Florida nursing homes to prepare and provide adequate supplies of protective wear and the Florida Department of Health issued guidelines to stop the spread of COVID-19. On March 11, DeSantis placed limits on who could visit nursing homes. On March 23, the <i>Miami Herald,</i> seeking the name of every elder care facility that had a positive test for COVID-19, filed a public records request with the Florida Department of Health and the Agency for Health Care Administration. The governor's office refused to release the information. On April 9, the <i>Miami Herald</i> provided the required notification to the State of Florida that they would be filing a lawsuit to obtain the information. After receiving a call from the governor's office, however, the <i>Miami Herald's</i> law firm, Holland &amp; Knight, dropped the case. The <i>Miami Herald</i> planned to proceed with a different law firm. The government subsequently released a list that, by April 21, included 313 facilities where either caregivers or residents had tested positive. The list was incomplete and did not provide data on the number of individuals infected or deceased.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Public_universities\">Public universities</span></h3>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1033289096\">\n\n<p>On March 10, Joseph Glover, the provost of the University of Florida (UF), sent out a recommendation to UF professors to transition their classes online.

Several leagues postponed or suspended their seasons starting March 12. Major League Baseball (MLB) canceled the remainder of spring training, and announced that the season would be postponed indefinitely. The National Basketball Association announced the season would be suspended for 30 days, affecting the Miami Heat and Orlando Magic. The National Hockey League season was suspended indefinitely, affecting the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay Lightning. The Miami Open, a major tennis tournament on the ATP Tour and WTA Tour was canceled for the first time in its history on March 12.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Professional_wrestling.3B_state_exceptions_on_sports\"></span><span id=\"Professional_wrestling;_state_exceptions_on_sports\">Professional wrestling; state exceptions on sports</span></h4>\n<p>In the wake of sports cancellations, the professional wrestling promotions All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and WWE re-located their weekly television programs (which normally toured to different arenas each episode) to sites in Florida in mid-March. AEW filmed its <i>AEW Dynamite</i> and all pay-per-views at Daily's Place in Jacksonville (which shares ownership with AEW via its lead investor Shahid Khan) until April 1, and WWE filmed all of its programming at its WWE Performance Center training facility in Orlando (including its flagship event WrestleMania 36, which was originally to be held at Tampa's Raymond James Stadium). Both promotions were filmed behind closed doors with no audience and only essential staff present. AEW re-located to a closed set in Norcross, Georgia on April 1, where it filmed content through April 3.</p><p>On April 9, the Division of Emergency Management amended its state-wide stay-at-home order, categorizing employees of \"professional sports and media production with a national audience,\" if closed to the general public, essential workers. The following Monday, April 13, Mayor of Orange County Jerry Demings confirmed that this change would allow WWE to continue its closed door tapings in the state, and were implemented following discussions with the office of Governor DeSantis. It was subsequently reported that WWE was warned of the stay-at-home restrictions by officials, but that DeSantis deemed the company's operations critical to Florida's economy, and approved the new exemption in response.</p><p>The next day, DeSantis defended his decision, explaining that, \"if you think about it, we have never had a period like this in modern American history where you've had so little new content, particularly in the sporting realm,\" and suggested that other closed-door sporting events — such as golf (particularly, a proposed rematch between Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson) and NASCAR races — could also be held under the new exception. Secretary of the Department of Business and Professional Regulation Halsey Beshears had also made a post on Twitter directed to the mixed martial arts promotion UFC on April 7, suggesting that his department could help sanction their events there (however, after it intended to hold UFC 249 and other fights at a tribal casino in California, the promotion suspended all events indefinitely on April 9, by request of its U.S. rightsholders ESPN Inc. and The Walt Disney Company).</p><p><i>Orlando Sentinel</i> columnists Mike Bianchi and Scott Maxwell questioned whether these actions were intended to help the state gain favor from the Trump administration; WWE owner and chairman Vince McMahon has been an ally of Trump, who had made recurring appearances in WWE programming as a celebrity figure prior to his presidency, and was inducted to the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame in 2013. The same day as Deming's announcement, America First Action — a super PAC led by McMahon's wife and former Administrator of the Small Business Administration, Linda McMahon — pledged $18.5 million on advertising in Florida for Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. On April 14, McMahon was named to a federal advisory group on the \"re-opening\" of the country's economy, joining other notable sports figures. During the daily press briefing, Trump addressed him and UFC head Dana White (who is also a Trump ally) with the title, \"The Great.\"</p><p>Following the implementation of this exception, several sporting events were announced for the state; on April 24, UFC announced that a new UFC 249 and two UFC Fight Night cards would be held in Jacksonville in May. Two televised golf events benefiting COVID-19-related causes were scheduled for local courses, including TaylorMade Driving Relief at Seminole Golf Club—a skins game by NBC Sports and Golf Channel featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff —on May 17, and <i>The Match: Champions for Charity</i> on May 24 at Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound—a four-ball competition by Turner Sports featuring Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson paired with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.  On May 14, NASCAR announced a new June 14 date for its postponed Dixie Vodka 400 at Homestead–Miami Speedway. On May 23, All Elite Wrestling returned to Jacksonville for its pay-per-view Double or Nothing (relocated from Las Vegas), with most of the event being held at Daily's Place, and a main event \"Stadium Stampede\" match within the confines of neighboring TIAA Bank Field.</p>\n<h4><span id=\"Return_to_play_in_professional_sports\">Return to play in professional sports</span></h4>\n<p>On May 23, the NBA confirmed that it was in talks with Walt Disney World in Orlando to use it as one or more centralized sites for the resumption of the NBA season. On June 4, the league approved a plan to host the remainder of the season at Walt Disney World's ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. Major League Soccer similarly announced on June 10 that it would host the one-off MLS is Back Tournament at the same site, with all 26 MLS clubs competing to qualify for the 2021 CONCACAF Champions League.</p><p>As part of the NHL's return-to-play, training facilities reopened on June 10. On June 19, a number of COVID-19 cases were reported among team training facilities in Florida, including the Philadelphia Phillies (MLB) and Tampa Bay Lightning (NHL). In Major League Baseball, the Toronto Blue Jays temporarily closed its spring training facility in Dunedin after a player showed signs of symptoms. In combination with similar concerns regarding facilities in Arizona, all MLB spring training facilities were closed league-wide for cleaning. On June 24, WWE announced that multiple cases had been recorded among its staff, including performers and on-air personality Renee Young. WWE stated that it would now test all performers prior to its television broadcasts.  Minor League Baseball, headquartered in St. Petersburg, announced on June 30 that the 2020 season would not be played, affecting all teams statewide and nationally.</p><p>With the introduction of Phase 3, some of Florida's sports teams began to reintroduce in-person spectators in late-2020, though still voluntarily limiting capacity in accordance with federal guidance. Super Bowl LV was held at Raymond James Stadium on February 7, 2021, with the stadium hosting just under 25,000 spectators. Two months later, Raymond James Stadium hosted WrestleMania 37, WWE's first in-person event since the onset of the pandemic. WWE had originally planned to host WrestleMania 37 at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, but delayed their hosting to 2023 due to current health orders in the state, and to compensate for Tampa not being able to host the event in 2020.</p><p>Due to Canadian border restrictions, multiple professional sports teams based in the country temporarily re-located their home games to sites in Florida for all or part of their 2020 and/or 2021 seasons, including the Toronto Raptors (Tampa Bay), Toronto Blue Jays (who began the season at their Spring Training home of TD Ballpark in Dunedin), and Major League Soccer's CF Montreal and Toronto FC (Fort Lauderdale and Orlando).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"See_also\">See also</span></h2>\n<ul><li>Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States</li>\n<li>COVID-19 pandemic in the United States – for impact on the country</li>\n<li>COVID-19 pandemic – for impact on other countries</li></ul><h2><span id=\"Notes\">Notes</span></h2>\n\n<h2><span id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<link rel=\"mw-deduplicated-inline-style\" href=\"mw-data:TemplateStyles:r1011085734\">\n<h2><span id=\"External_links\">External links</span></h2>\n\n<ul><li>COVID-19 information from the Florida Department of Health</li>\n<li>County COVID-19 Policies &amp; Orders from the Florida Institute for County Government</li></ul>"}]}}
