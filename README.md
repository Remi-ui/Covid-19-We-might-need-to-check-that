# A new dataset and baseline for an end-to-end verification pipeline for COVID-19 related claims

Name: Remi Th√ºss

Supervisor: Tommaso Caselli

This repository contains all code used for my Master Thesis on creating a new dataset called CovidCheck and baseline for an end-to-end verification pipeline for COVID-19 related claims. The verification pipelines consists of 4 steps: check-wortiness, document retrieval, paragraph retrieval and NLI (natural language inference). CovidCheck allows testing for each step of the verification pipeline as seen in the following figure:

## How to use
All code can be excecuted using the Jupiter Notebook files. The necessary dependencies will be downloaded and imported within the notebook files. The files contain instructions on how to replicate results presented in the report.

### Check-wortiness
For check-wortiness use the _check_worthiness.ipynb_ file.

### Document retrieval
For document retrieval use the _document_retrieval.ipynb_ file.

### Paragraph retrieval
For paragraph retrieval use the _paragraph_retrieval.ipynb_ file.

### Natural Language Inference
For Natural Language Inference use the _NLI.ipynb_ and _summarization.ipynb_ files.
